# Spam Detection API
 Overview
This project implements a REST API for a spam detection and user search service, similar to popular apps that identify spam phone numbers and allow users to search for people by name or phone number. The API is built using Node.js and TypeORM for ORM functionality, with a relational database as the backend.
